    <h4>Step 1</h4>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
        <p>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rapid boil. Cook egg noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain.</p>
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
        <p>While the egg noodles are cooking, melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large, oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms, peas, and onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, and cayenne.</p>
    <h4>Step 4</h4>
        <p>Sprinkle flour over the vegetables; cook and stir for 2 minutes. Add milk and chicken broth and bring to a simmer. Cook until thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat.</p>
    <h4>Step 5</h4>
        <p>Add drained egg noodles to the vegetable mixture, along with Cheddar cheese, tuna, 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, parsley, dill, chives, and lemon juice; stir until well combined.</p>
    <h4>Step 6</h4>
        <p>Combine remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan with panko and 1 tablespoon melted butter. Sprinkle over the casserole.</p>
    <h4>Step 7</h4>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven until golden and bubbly, 17 to 19 minutes.</p>
