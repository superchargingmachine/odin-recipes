    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>pireheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rapid boil. Cook egg noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>While the egg noodles are cooking, melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large, oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms, peas, and onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, and cayenne.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle flour over the vegetables; cook and stir for 2 minutes. Add milk and chicken broth and bring to a simmer. Cook until thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat.</li>
            <li>Add drained egg noodles to the vegetable mixture, along with Cheddar cheese, tuna, 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, parsley, dill, chives, and lemon juice; stir until well combined.</li>
            <li>Combine remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan with panko and 1 tablespoon melted butter. Sprinkle over the casserole.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden and bubbly, 17 to 19 minutes.</li>
